# Barcode

Barcode was an assassin script that I became a dev on since I became friends with one of the owners.

I had nothing to do with the "extras" tab (that was handled by the owners), so the autofarms you may see never went into production
and nothing in the extras tab will be in here

The kavo module file was a modified version of the kavo ui library.
I added support for handling the closing of the GUI.
I ended up switching over to my own ui library in the end.

Skin changer never worked :(
